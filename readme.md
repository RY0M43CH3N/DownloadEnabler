Download Enabler
================================================================================

The official PS Vita&trade; webbrowser is only able to downloaded media files. 
This plugin removes that limitation and allows you to download any files from the webbrowser to `ux0:downloads`.
There is however a bug in the webbrowser that makes secure links unaccessable, therefore not all files can be downloaded.

### Installation
Copy `download_enabler.suprx` to `ux0:tai` and write the path to `*main` as follows

```text
*main
ux0:tai/download_enabler.suprx
```

Reboot your device and enjoy your improved webbrowser.
